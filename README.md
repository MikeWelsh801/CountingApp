# CountingApp
by Michael Welsh

This is a simple app that allows the user to calculate choice or permutations given as command line arguments.

Command line arguments are an integer followed by "choose" or "permute" and another integer. Follows traditional
choosing conventions. Choose and permute are not case sensitive.

For Example: If the command line arguments are 6 choose 3, the result will be 20.
